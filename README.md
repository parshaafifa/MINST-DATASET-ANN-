# MINST-DATASET-ANN-
# MNIST Digit Classification with TensorFlow/Keras

This repository contains a simple neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## Overview

The MNIST dataset includes 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each sized 28x28 pixels. This project demonstrates:

- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
- Building a feedforward neural network with dropout regularization
- Training the model and visualizing training accuracy
- Evaluating model performance on the test set
- Predicting and displaying sample digits with their labels
